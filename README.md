# Chocolate-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-

### Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive sales analytics dashboard in Power BI using a star schema with multiple tables and
optimized data modelling for analyzing chocolate sales, costs, and profits.
• Implemented DAX measures for advanced time intelligence calculations (MoM/YoY changes) and leveraged KPI
cards, dynamic trend charts, and conditional formatting for insightful data visualization.
• Enhanced shipment analysis through grouping, histogram charts, and zoom slider functionality, ensuring
efficient data exploration and trend identification.
• Incorporated bookmarks, slicer panels, drill-through filters, and page navigation to enhance interactivity and
improve the end-user experience.
• Designed a dedicated measure table to streamline calculations and configured tooltips, reference labels, and alert
icons to provide contextual insights.
• Utilized Power Query transformations, calculated columns, and measure branching, published the dashboard to
Power BI Service, and created a GitHub portfolio page to demonstrate project outcomes effectively.
